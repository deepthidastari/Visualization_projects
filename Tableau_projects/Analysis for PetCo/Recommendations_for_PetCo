Recommendation 1: My first recommendation to PetCo comes from analyzing how the successful
test takers are distributed across the world. This graph shows where all the test takers who have
completed the tests , come from and clearly most of them are concenterated in the United States. This
led me to group all the countries other than United States and compare their numbers to the U.S and
we still see that United states outperforms all the rest of the countires and hence, I wanted to deep dive
into the numbers for United States by State. From the map, we clearly see that some states like CA, NC,
TX, NY have the highest numbers. Knowing this distribution by states presents two opportunities:
1. PetCo can analyze what they are doing different in these high performing vs low performing
states.

2. PetCo now knows where to expand their marketing efforts

Recommendation 2: My next piece of analysis was to validate the usual perception that offering tests
for free will entice the test takers to complete more tests. So I plotted the tests completion percentage
in the two groups ie ; the free -users and the non- free users group. I only focused on the first 4 tests for
comparison because the free-users group is offered only the 4 test for free. We see that even though
the tests number 2, 3 and 4 were offered for free, only 87% of the test takers completed test #2 where
as 95% of the people who were not offered free tests completed the tests. So, this clearly shows that
offering tests for free doesn’t encourage the users to finish the tests, instead, if you look at test
completion percentage for those who are subscribed vs those who are not, we see that a greater
percentage of subscribed users finish the tests. So, my second recommendation is to stop offering free
tests and instead, offer discounts on subscriptions that PetCo offers.

Recommendation 3: And to do that, PetCo needs to know what is a good day/time to reach out to
its customers with those promotional emails offering discounts. This graph shows that most of the users
enter their dog’s test results on Sunday and we also see that there is clearly a favorite time for when the
users are most active , which is 7 pm.

So summing up, PetCo needs to target users in states where the participation is the lowest by
offering discounts on subscriptions which have proved to show better completion rates than free tests
and send those promotional emails on the specific day and time, when the users are most active and
have a greater chance to take advantage of those discounts.
